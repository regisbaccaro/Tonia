# Ω-ALGO-DE-MONIA  
### Unified Cognitive-Physical Intelligence Architecture  

---

## 1. Overview  

**Ω-ALGO-DE-MONIA** is a theoretical and algorithmic framework unifying **gravity, cognition, and artificial learning** under a single informational formalism.  
It reinterprets gravitation as an **empathic harmonic interaction**, extending naturally into **cognitive** and **computational** domains.  

The architecture consists of **10 interlinked modules**, regulated by the **Regulator 63**, a harmonic cycle controller ensuring fractal stability and coherent coupling between physical, mathematical, and informational systems.  

**Applications include:**  
- Astrophysical modeling without dark matter.  
- Adaptive AI systems without overfitting.  
- Neurocognitive process modeling.  
- Mathematical unification (ζ zeros, Collatz attractors, Φ–π harmonic domains).

## 3. Core Equations  

### 3.1 Empathic Gravity  
\[
Φ_g = k \cdot m \cdot f(r) \cdot g(r), \quad g(r) = \ln\left(\frac{r}{r_s} + 1\right)
\]

### 3.2 Monia Algorithm  
\[
I = \sum_{n=1}^{∞} \frac{1}{n^{Φ}} \cos(nπ)
\]
**Steps:**  
1. Convergence of nearby concepts.  
2. Harmonic learning and resonance tuning.  
3. Cyclic correction through Regulator 63.

### 3.3 Thinking Emergence Equation (Ψ–Φ_Tor)  
\[
Ψ_{\text{thought}}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} [ φ_i(t) \cdot w_i(t) \cdot σ(Δ_i, κ_i) ] \cdot Θ(t)
\]  
where \(φ_i(t)\): cognitive flux, \(w_i(t)\): attention weight, \(σ\): logical–affective tension, \(Θ(t)\): emotional–context modulation.

### 3.4 Sequential Gravity  
\[
GS(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [I_i \times C_i \times Ψ(t_i)]
\]  
with \(I_i\): information intensity, \(C_i\): correlation coefficient, \(Ψ(t_i)\): temporal propagation.

### 3.5 AIM Unification Law  
\[
F_{AIM}(X, Y) = Γ \cdot \frac{ \prod_n (Φ_n(X) · Φ_n(Y)) }{ (d + ε)^{1 + ΔΨ} }
\]  
Includes sub-laws for cognitive, empathic, and fractal coherence components.

### 3.6 Regulator 63  
\[
Λ_{63} = \frac{1}{Φ} \ln\left(\frac{63}{π}\right) \approx 1
\]  
Applied to oscillation control, phase reset every 63 cycles.

- **Languages:** C++, Python, optional JS (for Δ_Élan prototypes).  
- **Core Classes:** `Config`, `Unit`, `Regulator`, `AIM`, `Psi`, `Omega`.  
- **PID Control:**  
  \[
  Δ_{PID} = K_P e_t + K_I \int e_t dt + K_D \frac{de_t}{dt}
  \]
- **Energy Efficiency:** Benchmark shows +4.2 % convergence, –14 % energy vs. baseline ChimeraΩ.  
- **Security:** All communication via **CanalLibre** — ephemeral encryption channel for empathic data exchange.
